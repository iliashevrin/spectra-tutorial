# Spectra Tutorial

This Spectra Tutorial has been developedCode as a technical briefing for ICSE 2021. 

This repository contains examples of specification used in a series of videos available in a YouTube playlist: [Reactive Synthesis with Spectra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGyeoukah9Nbx1QquUmZGdLulFZIsiRlZ). Each module contains an introduction (linked video), a task (explained in the video), example code (in this repository to be imported as Eclipse projects), and a solution (second linked video).

We suggest going through the modules in the following order (order of the playlist above):
* [0a] Reactive synthesis with Spectra [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHYFRMfK2pg&list=PLGyeoukah9Nbx1QquUmZGdLulFZIsiRlZ&index=1)
* [0b] Installation and Import [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smDcuR3NP44&list=PLGyeoukah9Nbx1QquUmZGdLulFZIsiRlZ&index=2)
